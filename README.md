 Flsun-SRKlipper configuration for Flsun SR with MKS Robin Nano V3

This is my configuration, of course some parameters are specific to my printer. You will need to run a calibration and set the Z offset, then a mesh.
Everything is stock, so the rotation_distance is correct, but calibrated for my filament. You may want to do your own extruder calibration (recommended),
but at least you have a value to start with.
Tested and working fine.
